Command: 
python phase2.py <xyz.cpy File>

For our Tests:
python phase2.py test.cpy
python phase2.py test2.cpy

Notes:
1) Argument 1 is used for .int and .sym files
2) If there is a lex runtime error, it is propably because .cpy code file needs one extra line at the end of the file
3) There is a possibility we missed a comment check at some .cpy code patterns/regions
